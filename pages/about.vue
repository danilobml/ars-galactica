I was born in Turkey, graduated in Molecular Biology in Ankara and I'm currently a PhD candidate in neurobiology at the Charit√© Medical School in Berlin. Painting, especially scientific and astronomical themes, such as stars, supernovas and blackholes, as well as music and culture, are what move my artistic heart. I hope they inspire you too!</p>
